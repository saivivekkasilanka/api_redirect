Sir, unable to complete the given question because we never worked on fastify.js and I tried hard to develop the api but can't able to do it sir. 
Thank you for your consideration sir.

Sir I know how to use URL module in node.js
 
example code:
var fs = require('fs'),
    http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  fs.readFile('abc.txt' + req.url, function (err,data) {
    if (err) {
      res.writeHead(404);
      res.end(JSON.stringify(err));
      return;
    }
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(data);
  });
}).listen(8080);


in 11th line we have a file named abc.txt whatever content saved on file will be printed on the web browser
